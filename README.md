# Aidan Mackey Portfolio Website
## AidanMackey.net

Website is created in the JavaScript framework Vue.js with the SCSS package installed. I developed this website from scratch as a personal project to learn more about Vue.Js as well as have one central place to learn about my life as a programmer and student.
